Given most of this discussion isn't related to general Apple II  
programming, I think a separate mailing list is appropriate.  People  
who just want to follow along with the discussion are definitely more  
than welcome, though!

Well, I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree here.   
But I think it's less confusing and practical for the end users if  
the Apple II programs were split out from the PC/Mac/Linux program.   
But I'm willing to concede on this point right now.

I find using source code control useful even when I'm the only  
programmer.  Benefits include not having to worry about breaking  
working code: I can always go back to a working version.  Easily  
being able to code on multiple machines: I can check out the code and  
development independently.  A simple backup solution: checked in code  
is backed up to at least two machines.  And Subversion in particular  
is implemented very well.

&gt;<i> Also at this point I'd like to point out that the OSX does not

True, but you can add one really easily to an current day Mac:

I use a one (albeit a different brand) on my PowerBook and it works  
awesome!  Not just for Apple II's, either.

Linards has joined the list, too.  Welcome!  I'll start a separate  
thread for our ADT13 questions.
