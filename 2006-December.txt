Subject: [adt-dev] Updates to ADT in 2006
Message-ID: <458A03DA.7000500@attglobal.net>

Hello, ADT dev listers -

I went ahead and updated ADT with a couple of goodies (staying home with 
chicken-pox infested kids).  I took Dave's ca65 assembler version, and 
added IIgs support at 115.2kbps and the ability to BSAVE itself. 
Benefits: legitimate IIgs support in one package, and no more reliance 
on a separate BASIC configuration module.

I'd like to release this as ADT_2006.  The package would be just the 
same as ADT_2005_2, except the ssc and iigs versions would be deleted 
with this one in its place.  So, it isn't exactly grand unification, but 
it merges a couple of versions - and brings the IIgs version up to real 
release status.

The source is in svn now.  I've integrated this all with an Eclipse and 
ca65-based build system (simply because it's easy for me) that produces 
a complete .dsk image and monitor dump version as well.  I'll go ahead 
and do the release after some more testing and a period for comments.
