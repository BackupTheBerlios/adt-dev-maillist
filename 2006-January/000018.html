Instead of a long explanation, you might want to check out the version 
as it currently stands (my work plus an improvement by &quot;Lyrical Nanoha&quot;):

</I>
Just read the included &quot;README.TXT&quot;, it will make the process clear. And 
no, you don't need to have a 13-sector disk already available at the 
beginning.

&gt;<i> Okay, cool.  Hopefully we can integrate this into the source code in  
</I>&gt;<i> the future.  That will make sure updates, like 115K, get included.
</I>
I'll have to look through the binary again myself I fear and produce an 
updated version of the assembly source.

&gt;<i> Yeah, I'm thinking that maybe adding two new commands would be  
</I>&gt;<i> worthwhile, to maintain backwards compatibility with 16 sector  
</I>&gt;<i> transfers.  ADT currently sends 0xD2 ('R') or 0xD3 ('S') to initiate  a 
</I>&gt;<i> receive or send, respectively.  I was going to use 0xD4 for  sending 
</I>&gt;<i> .NIB disks, and maybe reserve 0xD5 for receiving .NIB disks  (I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> plan on supporting that right now, though).
</I>
I'd be interested in tackling this at some point. I have very few 
original disks so the NIB-to-PC transfer is of little interest to me. On 
the other hand I like to run stuff on the real hardware; for this NIB is 
a real show-stopper until now.

&gt;<i>  So maybe ADT13  should use 
</I>&gt;<i> 0xD6 and 0xD7 for 13 sector disks?
</I>
Should be a small change and easily possible. On the Apple side a 
unified executable doesn't make that much sense, since it relies on the 
underlying DOS anyway; ADT13 must reside on a 13-sector disk and 
16-sector ADT must reside on a 16-sector disk as things stand. But on 
the PC side this change would allow a unified executable.

&gt;<i> The way nibble transfer will work, I think it'll still be worthwhile  to 
</I>&gt;<i> have ADT13.  First off, nibble transfers are much slower, since it  
</I>&gt;<i> transfers one track at a time, where ADT13 will do 7.
</I>
Why? A nibble ADT could overwrite DOS, and thus have all the memory from 
$0800 to $BFFF at its disposal. At $1A00 bytes per track this is still 
enough for 7 tracks. Subtract the space used by the code itself, and 6 
tracks should fit into memory.

&gt;<i> Plus, nibble  
</I>&gt;<i> transfers don't do any error checking/correction on the data.
</I>
Well... they don't do it unless you code it in. ;-)

&gt;<i> Using  
</I>&gt;<i> RWTS results in more robust disk transfers, since it uses checksums  and 
</I>&gt;<i> retries on each sector prolog, data, and epilog.
</I>
But of course checksuming and retrying can be hand-coded into a nibble 
transfer. It's more work though, I'll concur with that.

&gt;<i> That's a possibility.  I was planning on supporting the convention of  
</I>&gt;<i> high bit clear means a 10-bit sync, and both high bit and low bit  clear 
</I>&gt;<i> means a 9-bit sync.
</I>
That has the problem that there might exist 10-bit syncs with the low 
bit clear as well as set; and also 9-bit syncs with both kinds of low bits.

I believe if one really wants to transfer a reliable, complete 
bit-stream off the disk, one must read the track several times anyway, 
since variations in disk speed can get sync bytes to seemingly appear or 
disappear at random during a read. Only way to be sure is to read 
several times and compare.

&gt;<i>  But this point is moot right now, since I  was not planning 
</I>&gt;<i> on being able to receive nibble images, only send. This is mainly 
</I>&gt;<i> because the .NIB format does not keep track of sync  bytes, which would 
</I>&gt;<i> be needed to write the disk correctly.
</I>
Yes, .NIB is a stinker. Isn't there a better, newer nibble-based format 
already out there that preserves sync bytes and track lenghts? The most 
versatile way to me seems to be: treating the track simply as a sequence 
of bits of a certain lenght, and sorting out syncs by simulating the way 
the woz machine itself works. You can always convert the stuff to .NIB 
after-the-fact if you absolutely need this format.

In the PC-to-Apple direction, the only way to deal with .NIB is to use a 
couple of heuristics to guess which bytes are sync bytes.
