<PRE>Hello Dave,

I'd like to include the BASICS.DSK file, update the distribution disk 
from DOS 3.2 to DOS 3.2.1 and update the README a bit. Probably I'll do 
it tonight or tomorrow night, but no promises. What do you mean by &quot;post 
it&quot;? I don't have a website at this time. I can mail it or ftp-upload it 
to somebody of course.

&gt;<i> I know we've got a couple of questions about ADT13.  How did you go  
</I>&gt;<i> about implementing it?
</I>
The main rule was &quot;minimal changes&quot;. And the changes required were 
indeed very small. Just read and write only 13 sectors per track instead 
of 16. Transfer 7*13*256 bytes instead of 7*16*256 bytes in one go. And 
modify the displays on both sides to show only 13 sectors per track. 
Plus a few cosmetic changes to the text messages. That's it. The main 
change is really the use of DOS 3.2 instead of DOS 3.3, ADT itself was 
changed very little.

&gt;<i> Do you have the source code (both Apple II  and 
</I>&gt;<i> PC) available?
</I>
Yes, though I used mainly the Unix version on the PC side. I didn't 
reassemble the Apple II side executable, I just went through the hex 
machine code with the help of the assembly source and patched it with a 
hex editor. Nothing was relocated or moved around, so you can just 
compare the two directly with a binary-compare program to find the 
changes. Of course on the PC side I edited the source, fixing a couple 
of warnings while I was at it, and recompiled.

I should add that I worked off the old ADT version, as the 115200 bps 
version wasn't available yet when I started this.

 &gt; And how did you change the ADT protocol to handle  the
&gt;<i> new disk format?
</I>
Hardly at all. Just send fewer bytes. All the handshaking remained 
unchanged.

&gt;<i> Any information you could give would be  helpful!  
</I>&gt;<i> There seems to be some active development going on in the  ADT world, 
</I>&gt;<i> and it would be nice if all the variations worked  together, or at the 
</I>&gt;<i> very least, not step on each other's toes.
</I>
Well, running 16-sector ADT on on side and ADT13 on the other is 
definitely not going to work. Probably it will just lock up because one 
side is waiting for more bytes and the other thinks it's done. Pressing 
ESC should get you out of this, though.

It might be worthwhile to change the ADT13 handshaking so that there 
needs to be only one executable on the PC side which can determine which 
one is running on the apple, and which &quot;speaks&quot; both languages.

On the other hand, if the nibble-based ADT becomes a reality in the near 
future, all the differences between .dsk and .d13 can be handled on the 
PC side anyway, and there'll be no longer a need to run DOS 3.2 to 
transfer 13-sector disks.

Let me make a suggestion for a future nibble ADT: I suggest handling all 
sync-byte issues entirely on the PC side. Let the Apple side just write 
bytes, one per 32 cycles no matter what. The Disk II controller can only 
read bytes starting with a 1, but it can write all bytes; so instead of 
telling it to write FF FF FF FF FF at 40-cycle steps, one can just tell 
it to write FF 3F CF F3 FC FF as standard 32-cycle bytes and the result 
will be the same. This way all that bit-banging can happen on the PC, 
where it's probably easier to program anyway. And this way it's also 
easy to implement the ability to handle both 36-cycle and 40-cycle syncs.

Greetz,
