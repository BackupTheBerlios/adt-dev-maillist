<PRE>Pardon mw while I catch up.  I've been busy...  Forgive any redundancies:


Dave Dribin wrote:
 &gt; Ed and Knut, Thanks for joining the list!

Thankx for putting up a discussion list for this project.  It seems abit 
of a shame though that we arn't using the CSA2 Programmer sig.  The 
disussion may draw more interest.  :)

  &gt; I  propose one for each Apple II program, and one for each PC side
 &gt; program.

 &gt; They just need to download 2 files, instead of one.

 &gt; I think it is better for the user to get a functioning package.

I would like to concur with Knut that one downlaod per platform 
(PC/Mac/Linux/ whatever) would be more efficient and practical for those 
who need it.  (That's right, the USERS.)

Knut Roll-Lund
 &gt; the only point I'm really going to fight for is that we use version 
numbers so that there will be no confusion about what is what.

I think the naming convention and file type convention should match the 
platform.  ATD(date).zip, ATD(date).SHK, and ADT(dat).rar or whatever 
for Win/Dos, Mac, and Linux respectively.  This also would allow us 
unlimited flexibility and making sure no one is confused about which 
version they have.  Of coursethe version number coudl easily replace the 
date code I noted above.  (I'm easy.)

Dave Dribin wrote:
 &gt; Put All ADT Source Code Into Subversion

This may be overkill after looking at the code involved, number of 
people who are actively working on it and the likelyhood of others 
wanting to expand the project.  But I LOVE that it will be online for 
other to look at.

 &gt; wxWidgets is a cross-platform, open source GUI library, available for
 &gt; Windows, Unix, and OS X.  Using wxWidgets for ADTWin would
 &gt; automatically give use GUIs for Linux and OS X.  I've used wxWidgets
 &gt; before, and the ADT GUI is a perfect use for it.

Also at this point I'd like to point out that the OSX does not generally 
have access to a serial port so it may be a mute thought.  (Unless it is 
a really old G3.)

Great, but don't forget the 'other' two serial cards for the Apple II, 
the IIgs serial port and the original serial card.  They woudl also ned 
theier own library.  None of the serial port types can use each other's 
settings or control signals.  For Eg, the SSC is the only port to 
support 115,200b for example.  While the IIgs serial hardware should 
support 57,600 and maybe some others fine.

Knut Roll-Lund wrote:
 &gt; I would think that if it &lt;SST and ADT&gt; can be combined seamlessly for 
the user it can  be the same.

I agree, so long as it works and is appropriately documented, the user 
will not care if it is the same 'server' on the PC side with different 
clients on the A2.

 &gt; BTW shouldn't we invite also Linards Ticmanis &quot;ticmanis at gmx dot
 &gt; de&quot; he has made the 13 sector ADT.
Dave Dribin wrote:
 &gt; Sure, go ahead

Good observation, Knut, let me know if this still needs to be done.

Dave Dribin wrote:
 &gt; Hmm...  I wonder how he &lt;Lenards&gt; changed the protocol. &lt;for ADT13&gt; 
  The file doesn't seem  to  be available on Asimov.  Too bad there is 
no source.
Knut Roll-lund wrote:
 &gt; I believe it is a &quot;hacked&quot; software, so no source exists
...
 &gt; He seems to be active on c.s.a2.  Maybe I'll send him email.

I know exactly how he most likely did this, it's an old trick with 
demuffin.  You use the DOS 3.2 RWTS in a lower memory location.  Of 
course I've not used ADT13 so I can't say for sure.  (Bload RWTS13, 
Bload ADT, Patch ADT to call 3.2 RWTS. (Two bytes in IOB pointer and 
change the sector counter code.)




My 2cents and to catch up!
Thankx,
Ed
