That sounds like a decent way to go, for now.

&gt;<i> Actually I don't yet have much information about this ADT-SST is

</I>&gt;<i> dsk files like SST or a new format, an SST dual disk image?
</I>
It's a modification of SST.  Instead of writing the raw nibbles to  
two DOS 3.3 disks, it will send them over the serial port.  The PC- 
side program will be able to create .NIB files directly.  No creating  
of two disks.  No transferring these disks using ADT.  And no need to  
run SST in an emulator.  I've added a new command.  The current ADT  
protocol has two commands: 'S' or an 'R' for sending and receiving  
disks, respectively.  I've added a new command: 'T' which sends  
a .NIB disk.  This makes it a completely backwards compatible  
extension to the ADT protocol.

&gt;<i> Is there a relationship between nib and SST? I was told that the  
</I>&gt;<i> nib format came from a copyprogram but when it doesn't have the  
</I>&gt;<i> sync information is this something that was dropped/lost when the  
</I>&gt;<i> nib format was created? Please tell me more.
</I>
I don't know exactly when .NIB files were introduced and if they were  
created in conjunction with SST, but .NIB files contain the raw  
nibble data, per track.  As far as I know, it does not keep the sync  
information.  This makes it impossible to go from .NIB back to disk,  
unfortunately.  SST does keep the sync information, so this is  
limitation of the .NIB file format.  Also, .NIB files cannot handle  
other, more complicated disk structures like half tracks, quarter  
tracks, and track synchronization.  If there were such a format  
available that was supported by emulators, SST would be able to  
support it.

BTW, I'm calling the ADT/SST merger SADT for &quot;Super ADT&quot;.

&gt;<i> I think making it cross-platform will create endless problems and  
</I>&gt;<i> is thus a waste of time. If I make a change and test this for  
</I>&gt;<i> windows and dos how can I check that my change is valid for linux  
</I>&gt;<i> and mac? Did you notice how much interest there was when it was  
</I>&gt;<i> requested a baudrate upping also for the mac version? or the gs  
</I>&gt;<i> version? I think the platforms must live their own lives.
</I>
Well, I wasn't around to test a Mac version. :)  And besides, there  
really is no working Mac or Linux version to modify.  There are 2  
versions of ADT for Unix floating out there.  Both are based off DOS  
ADT, and both versions are a mess (see below).  One doesn't support  
receiving disks, and one doesn't compile on OS X.  So, really, there  
is no Mac version for someone to &quot;add&quot; 115K support to.  I would have  
to start from scratch.

&gt;<i> I must admit I don't like C++. This is because it typically makes  
</I>&gt;<i> the code less readable by obscuring how things connect  
</I>&gt;<i> (abstracting). I realize that there are many tools that might help  
</I>&gt;<i> figuring such out (the later visual studio's are pretty  
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent). People always make &quot;spaghetti&quot; code and C++ makes it  
</I>&gt;<i> worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like heavily IFDEF'ed code. I deal with cross-platform  
</I>&gt;<i> development at work and it is a pain. We generate unreadable code  
</I>&gt;<i> because of macros. Sometimes we make changes that break another  
</I>&gt;<i> platform without realizing and end up wasting time on debugging. It  
</I>&gt;<i> is better that the only common thing is the protocol...
</I>
Well, in my opinion, spaghetti code has nothing to do with the  
language, and all to do with the programmer's use of a language.  For  
example, take the ADT for Unix code.  It's C, and it's a mess of  
#ifdef's and spaghetti code.  Well designed C++ makes abstracting  
things like cross platform differences *without* spaghetti code and  
differences.  I've seen it done, and it can be pretty.  Needless to  
say, if all you've seen is bas C++ code, you're just going to have to  
trust me on this. :)  Hopefully, once you see what I have you'll  
change your opinion.

&gt;<i> Dos ca65 work flawlessly (my experience is with sdcc for Z80; bad  
</I>&gt;<i> such)?
</I>
Yup.  More than flawlessly.  It's awesome. :)  It's stable, actively  
developed, and cross platform.  I'll post the ca65 version of  
adt.asm, so you can see for yourself.

&gt;<i> Just wondering; has anyone made an ansi c function library for  
</I>&gt;<i> Apple2 DOS3.3 and/or ProDOS on cc65? Did download it a while ago  
</I>&gt;<i> but haven't had time to look at it yet.
</I>
It doesn't have any DOS or ProDOS libraries.  Actually, the Apple2  
library for cc65 is pretty weak.  But the compiler and assembler  
itself are solid.  The thing is, if there *were* a serial library, it  
could be shared in ADT and SADT.  Even if it weren't reusable to  
other projects, it's possible to create

&gt;<i> BTW shouldn't we invite also Linards Ticmanis &quot;ticmanis at gmx dot  
</I>&gt;<i> de&quot; he has made the 13 sector ADT.
</I>
Sure, go ahead.  What is this 13 sector ADT?

&gt;<i> Well, there were some opinions, the only point I'm really going to  
</I>&gt;<i> fight for is that we use version numbers so that there will be no  
</I>&gt;<i> confusion about what is what.
</I>
I appreciate the input, so thanks for talking the time to respond!
