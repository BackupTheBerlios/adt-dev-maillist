I think it is better for the user to get a functioning package. I would 
rather give the package a proper version number (I broke the old year 
based one by releasing another 2005... didn't want to postpone the 
problem to 2006)

&gt;&gt;<i> That being said, I think it is a great idea to make distribution

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [ .. snip .. ]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The distribution will make sure they are compatible or else they

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but does it make sense?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No other modules including a a pure A2 version should be  necessary.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But each distribution module should contain whatever is  supported, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including all the A2 versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see that perspective.  I think the naming convention of  
</I>&gt;<i> ADT_XXXX.zip where XXXX is the year very poor, though.  Maybe this  
</I>&gt;<i> becomes the version number, and then the version number of the A2  
</I>&gt;<i> client gets bumped, even if there is no change.  Compatibility is  
</I>&gt;<i> determined by version.  Thus, ADT_1.23.zip contains ADTWin v1.23,  
</I>&gt;<i> ADTss v1.23, and ADTcc v1.23.   This results in possibility of ADTcc  
</I>&gt;<i> v1.22 being exactly the same as ADTcc v1.23, but at least everything  
</I>&gt;<i> in the zip file is named in a consistent way.  I still think this is  
</I>&gt;<i> less flexible than the separation I was proposing, but at least it's  
</I>&gt;<i> not quite as confusing.
</I>

I mean that if the protocol changes we &quot;up&quot; a major version, go to 2.00 
actually we might want to use 3 numbers, the first for protocol, the 
second for functionality and the third for bugfixes (like my last release).

&gt;&gt;<i> I think that if the ADT and SST can not be 'easily' combined into  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one A2 client, then they should remain separate and so should the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Other platform.  So you'd have ADTWin with ADTApple2(s) and SSTWin  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with SSTApple2 in one distribution, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This becomes confusing to the user, though.  Why should &quot;Other&quot; be  
</I>&gt;<i> separate?  And why must we force separate ADT and SST PC-side  
</I>&gt;<i> software?  They're 99% the same.  I was    planning for ADTWin and  
</I>&gt;<i> SSTWin to be the same program, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way I keep thinking about this is in terms of a protocol with  
</I>&gt;<i> clients and servers.   Clients and servers interact, so long as they  
</I>&gt;<i> speak the same protocol.  Clients and servers are developed and  
</I>&gt;<i> released independently, as improvements related to each occur.  The  
</I>&gt;<i> protocol stays constant.  As such, ADT is a protocol.  There may be  
</I>&gt;<i> more than one version of the protocol (pre-1.21 and post 1.22, for  
</I>&gt;<i> example), and future changes in protocol could be handled in a better  
</I>&gt;<i> way to ensure compatibility.  But this perspective does allow more  
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility.  And I don't think it's that much more confusing to the  
</I>&gt;<i> end user.  They just need to download 2 files, instead of one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my $.02... :)  Once I get ADT/SST far enough, maybe I'll try to  
</I>&gt;<i> implement this,  and see if it confuses people.
</I>

I would think that if it can be combined seamlessly for the user it can 
be the same.

Actually I don't yet have much information about this ADT-SST is going 
to work... Is it going to deal with nib files or with dual dsk files 
like SST or a new format, an SST dual disk image? Is there a 
relationship between nib and SST? I was told that the nib format came 
from a copyprogram but when it doesn't have the sync information is this 
something that was dropped/lost when the nib format was created? Please 
tell me more.

from the first message by Dave:

&gt;<i> For my ADT/SST merger, I've already done a fair amount of this  
</I>&gt;<i> restructuring.  One major change I did was to use C++ instead of C.   
</I>&gt;<i> All platforms we're targeting, including DOS, have good C++ compilers  
</I>&gt;<i> available.  C++ provides a lot more flexibility on code structure in  
</I>&gt;<i> my opinion, so I sort of made an executive decision to use it over  
</I>&gt;<i> C.  Also, using C++ will help us implement my next idea:  I'd also  
</I>&gt;<i> like ADTWin to use wxWidgets for it's GUI:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">http://www.wxwidgets.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> wxWidgets is a cross-platform, open source GUI library, available for  
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, Unix, and OS X.  Using wxWidgets for ADTWin would  
</I>&gt;<i> automatically give use GUIs for Linux and OS X.  I've used wxWidgets  
</I>&gt;<i> before, and the ADT GUI is a perfect use for it.
</I>
I think making it cross-platform will create endless problems and is 
thus a waste of time. If I make a change and test this for windows and 
dos how can I check that my change is valid for linux and mac? Did you 
notice how much interest there was when it was requested a baudrate 
upping also for the mac version? or the gs version? I think the 
platforms must live their own lives.

It seems that it was the intention of the creator of ADTwin that he 
would also create the dos version by applying a define. I don't know if 
this works or why it is not used. Maybe it is much larger than the 
original dos code... ADTwin is C++ but maybe not taken to its full 
potential... I must admit I don't like C++. This is because it typically 
makes the code less readable by obscuring how things connect 
(abstracting). I realize that there are many tools that might help 
figuring such out (the later visual studio's are pretty intelligent). 
People always make &quot;spaghetti&quot; code and C++ makes it worse.

I don't like heavily IFDEF'ed code. I deal with cross-platform 
development at work and it is a pain. We generate unreadable code 
because of macros. Sometimes we make changes that break another platform 
without realizing and end up wasting time on debugging. It is better 
that the only common thing is the protocol...

About ca65 conversion, I find it is pretty convenient to develop using 
merlin too, I edit in my favorite editor on the pc, transfers to a disk 
image and compiles in an emulator, not a slow process at all. The 
slowest part is to ADT the disk over to test the result on the real 
machine. With 155200 baud that isn't horribly slow either. Dos ca65 work 
flawlessly (my experience is with sdcc for Z80; bad such)? Just 
wondering; has anyone made an ansi c function library for Apple2 DOS3.3 
and/or ProDOS on cc65? Did download it a while ago but haven't had time 
to look at it yet.

BTW shouldn't we invite also Linards Ticmanis &quot;ticmanis at gmx dot de&quot; 
he has made the 13 sector ADT.

Well, there were some opinions, the only point I'm really going to fight 
for is that we use version numbers so that there will be no confusion 
about what is what.
