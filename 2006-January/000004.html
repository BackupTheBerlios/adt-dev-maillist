Yeah, the fact that newer PC-side versions are backwards compatible  
with older Apple II side was my main motivation for splitting the zip  
file up.

I can see that perspective.  I think the naming convention of  
ADT_XXXX.zip where XXXX is the year very poor, though.  Maybe this  
becomes the version number, and then the version number of the A2  
client gets bumped, even if there is no change.  Compatibility is  
determined by version.  Thus, ADT_1.23.zip contains ADTWin v1.23,  
ADTss v1.23, and ADTcc v1.23.   This results in possibility of ADTcc  
v1.22 being exactly the same as ADTcc v1.23, but at least everything  
in the zip file is named in a consistent way.  I still think this is  
less flexible than the separation I was proposing, but at least it's  
not quite as confusing.

&gt;<i> I think that if the ADT and SST can not be 'easily' combined into

</I>&gt;<i> with SSTApple2 in one distribution, for example.
</I>
This becomes confusing to the user, though.  Why should &quot;Other&quot; be  
separate?  And why must we force separate ADT and SST PC-side  
software?  They're 99% the same.  I was    planning for ADTWin and  
SSTWin to be the same program, for example.

The way I keep thinking about this is in terms of a protocol with  
clients and servers.   Clients and servers interact, so long as they  
speak the same protocol.  Clients and servers are developed and  
released independently, as improvements related to each occur.  The  
protocol stays constant.  As such, ADT is a protocol.  There may be  
more than one version of the protocol (pre-1.21 and post 1.22, for  
example), and future changes in protocol could be handled in a better  
way to ensure compatibility.  But this perspective does allow more  
flexibility.  And I don't think it's that much more confusing to the  
end user.  They just need to download 2 files, instead of one.

Just my $.02... :)  Once I get ADT/SST far enough, maybe I'll try to  
implement this,  and see if it confuses people.
