<PRE>Dave:
Your ideas hold merit.  But just a brief background about why it has 
developed as it has is because the the version's change only included 
the Windows and Apple version.

It should also be noted that the windows and Apple versions of the 
software have remained backwards compatible with other version since 
1.21? where a major compression algorithm was added.

I did emphasize when Knut was developing that the docs need to be 
updated to reflect this and to make certain that it was mentioned.

That being said, I think it is a great idea to make distribution modules 
for each platform that include the latest AppleII version for each.  No 
other modules including a a pure A2 version should be necessary.  But 
each distribution module should contain whatever is supported, including 
all the A2 versions.

SSC &amp; IIgs &amp; other with source code and whatever in each folder as they 
have been done in the past is good, regardless of the version.  Each one 
has different capabilities and should have their own version numbers. 
As long as the newer versions remain compatible, it makes no difference 
if you use the latest Windows version with an older ADT121, they still 
interact.  The distribution will make sure they are compatible or else 
they should not be included for that platform.  (It seems a bit verbose 
but does it make sense?)

I think that if the ADT and SST can not be 'easily' combined into one A2 
client, then they should remain separate and so should the Other 
platform.  So you'd have ADTWin with ADTApple2(s) and SSTWin with 
SSTApple2 in one distribution, for example.

Just make sure to document it all as best as you can to avoid confusion.

Thankx,
Ed

&gt;<i> Ed and Knut,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for joining the list!  I've been following ADT development for  
</I>&gt;<i> the last month or so, since I've been developing an ADT/SST merger.   
</I>&gt;<i> Given that there is now fairly active development going on between  the 
</I>&gt;<i> 3 of us, here are some ideas I've been thinking about that will  help us 
</I>&gt;<i> work together and coordinate our efforts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Splitting ADT_XXXX.zip into multiple files
</I>&gt;<i> ==========================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current method of distribution, by that I mean files like  
</I>&gt;<i> ADT_2005_2.zip, is confusing and inflexible.  It's confusing for the  
</I>&gt;<i> user, since it's hard to tell which version of ADT is included.  Is  it 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.23?  Or 1.21?  It's a pain for developers to release new  versions.  
</I>&gt;<i> If a new version of ADTWin needs to be released, why  include all the 
</I>&gt;<i> other components that have not changes?  Thus, I  think it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> better to have multiple zip files for download.  I  propose one for each 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple II program, and one for each PC side  program.  Given the current 
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the components as of today,  this would result in the 
</I>&gt;<i> following zip files:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple II components:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - adt-ssc-1.23.zip: Contains SSC version of adt.dmp (with 115K  support) 
</I>&gt;<i> and source code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - adt-cc-1.21.zip: Contains ADTcc.dmp and code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - adt-gs-0.91.zip: Contains ADTgs.dmp.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PC components:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - adt123.zip: Contains adtdos.exe (with 115K support).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - adt-win-1.23.2.zip: Contains adtwin.exe (with 115K support and long  
</I>&gt;<i> file name fixes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doing a split like this makes it easier to do updates like the ones  
</I>&gt;<i> recently done by Knut and my SST updates.  It also makes it easier to  
</I>&gt;<i> put this code into a source code repository, like Subversion.  Which  
</I>&gt;<i> leads me to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Put All ADT Source Code Into Subversion
</I>&gt;<i> =======================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using a source code control tool like Subversion or CVS is nearly  
</I>&gt;<i> essential when multiple developers are involved.  Without them,  people 
</I>&gt;<i> are constantly overwriting other's changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been using Subversion a lot at my &quot;real job&quot; and it's awesome.   
</I>&gt;<i> This is why I chose BerliOS, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using a Cross Assembler for Apple II Software
</I>&gt;<i> =============================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code for ADTssc and ADTcc are in Merlin assembler.  I think  
</I>&gt;<i> converting these to a cross assembler so that developement code be  done 
</I>&gt;<i> on a PC/Mac has number of advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Faster: Running an assembler on modern hardware is *fast*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Easier: I can use a modern text editor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - More flexible: Modern assemblers allow splitting programs into  
</I>&gt;<i> multiple files and have the concept of &quot;libraries&quot;.  Multiple files  
</I>&gt;<i> also help when multiple developers are involved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Makes some debugging easier: I can assembly on my PC/Mac and then  run 
</I>&gt;<i> the binary in an emulator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've already converted adt.asm into an assembly file that is usable  by 
</I>&gt;<i> ca65, which is the assembler component of cc65:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.cc65.org/">http://www.cc65.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Redesign of PC-Side Software
</I>&gt;<i> ============================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are currently two &quot;official&quot; PC-side programs: adtdos.exe and  
</I>&gt;<i> adt.exe.  Unfortunately, there is very little code sharing between  
</I>&gt;<i> them.  And this also excludes other platforms like Linux and Mac OS  X.  
</I>&gt;<i> The current code is currently not flexible enough to support this  kind 
</I>&gt;<i> of abstraction.  It really needs to be completely restructured  from 
</I>&gt;<i> scratch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For my ADT/SST merger, I've already done a fair amount of this  
</I>&gt;<i> restructuring.  One major change I did was to use C++ instead of C.   
</I>&gt;<i> All platforms we're targeting, including DOS, have good C++ compilers  
</I>&gt;<i> available.  C++ provides a lot more flexibility on code structure in  my 
</I>&gt;<i> opinion, so I sort of made an executive decision to use it over  C.  
</I>&gt;<i> Also, using C++ will help us implement my next idea:  I'd also  like 
</I>&gt;<i> ADTWin to use wxWidgets for it's GUI:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">http://www.wxwidgets.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> wxWidgets is a cross-platform, open source GUI library, available for  
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, Unix, and OS X.  Using wxWidgets for ADTWin would  
</I>&gt;<i> automatically give use GUIs for Linux and OS X.  I've used wxWidgets  
</I>&gt;<i> before, and the ADT GUI is a perfect use for it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Conclusion
</I>&gt;<i> ==========
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I know this is a lot of information.  If you manage to read all  
</I>&gt;<i> this, please let me know what you think.
</I>&gt;<i>
