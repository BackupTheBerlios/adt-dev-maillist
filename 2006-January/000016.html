No rush... Just send me the file in an email (offlist) when you get  
around to it, since you don't have any web space available.  I'll  
then upload it to BerliOS.

</I>&gt;<i> instead of DOS 3.3, ADT itself was changed very little.
</I>
Ahh... so it requires a DOS 3.2 floppy on the Apple II side?  Or does  
it install DOS 3.2 RWTS at a lower address concurrently with DOS 3.3?

&gt;&gt;<i> Do you have the source code (both Apple II  and PC) available?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, though I used mainly the Unix version on the PC side. I didn't  
</I>&gt;<i> reassemble the Apple II side executable, I just went through the  
</I>&gt;<i> hex machine code with the help of the assembly source and patched  
</I>&gt;<i> it with a hex editor. Nothing was relocated or moved around, so you  
</I>&gt;<i> can just compare the two directly with a binary-compare program to  
</I>&gt;<i> find the changes. Of course on the PC side I edited the source,  
</I>&gt;<i> fixing a couple of warnings while I was at it, and recompiled.
</I>
Okay, cool.  Hopefully we can integrate this into the source code in  
the future.  That will make sure updates, like 115K, get included.

&gt;<i> &gt; And how did you change the ADT protocol to handle  the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new disk format?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hardly at all. Just send fewer bytes. All the handshaking remained  
</I>&gt;<i> unchanged.
</I>
Okay.

&gt;<i> It might be worthwhile to change the ADT13 handshaking so that  
</I>&gt;<i> there needs to be only one executable on the PC side which can  
</I>&gt;<i> determine which one is running on the apple, and which &quot;speaks&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> both languages.
</I>
Yeah, I'm thinking that maybe adding two new commands would be  
worthwhile, to maintain backwards compatibility with 16 sector  
transfers.  ADT currently sends 0xD2 ('R') or 0xD3 ('S') to initiate  
a receive or send, respectively.  I was going to use 0xD4 for  
sending .NIB disks, and maybe reserve 0xD5 for receiving .NIB disks  
(I don't plan on supporting that right now, though).  So maybe ADT13  
should use 0xD6 and 0xD7 for 13 sector disks?

&gt;<i> On the other hand, if the nibble-based ADT becomes a reality in the  
</I>&gt;<i> near future, all the differences between .dsk and .d13 can be  
</I>&gt;<i> handled on the PC side anyway, and there'll be no longer a need to  
</I>&gt;<i> run DOS 3.2 to transfer 13-sector disks.
</I>
The way nibble transfer will work, I think it'll still be worthwhile  
to have ADT13.  First off, nibble transfers are much slower, since it  
transfers one track at a time, where ADT13 will do 7.  Plus, nibble  
transfers don't do any error checking/correction on the data.  Using  
RWTS results in more robust disk transfers, since it uses checksums  
and retries on each sector prolog, data, and epilog.

&gt;<i> Let me make a suggestion for a future nibble ADT: I suggest  
</I>&gt;<i> handling all sync-byte issues entirely on the PC side. Let the  
</I>&gt;<i> Apple side just write bytes, one per 32 cycles no matter what. The  
</I>&gt;<i> Disk II controller can only read bytes starting with a 1, but it  
</I>&gt;<i> can write all bytes; so instead of telling it to write FF FF FF FF  
</I>&gt;<i> FF at 40-cycle steps, one can just tell it to write FF 3F CF F3 FC  
</I>&gt;<i> FF as standard 32-cycle bytes and the result will be the same. This  
</I>&gt;<i> way all that bit-banging can happen on the PC, where it's probably  
</I>&gt;<i> easier to program anyway. And this way it's also easy to implement  
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to handle both 36-cycle and 40-cycle syncs.
</I>
That's a possibility.  I was planning on supporting the convention of  
high bit clear means a 10-bit sync, and both high bit and low bit  
clear means a 9-bit sync.  This would require some extra logic on the  
Apple II side, but the PC side would not need to convert a byte  
stream into a bit stream.  But this point is moot right now, since I  
was not planning on being able to receive nibble images, only send.   
This is mainly because the .NIB format does not keep track of sync  
bytes, which would be needed to write the disk correctly.
