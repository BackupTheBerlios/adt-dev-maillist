<PRE>Ed and Knut,

Thanks for joining the list!  I've been following ADT development for  
the last month or so, since I've been developing an ADT/SST merger.   
Given that there is now fairly active development going on between  
the 3 of us, here are some ideas I've been thinking about that will  
help us work together and coordinate our efforts:

Splitting ADT_XXXX.zip into multiple files
==========================================

The current method of distribution, by that I mean files like  
ADT_2005_2.zip, is confusing and inflexible.  It's confusing for the  
user, since it's hard to tell which version of ADT is included.  Is  
it 1.23?  Or 1.21?  It's a pain for developers to release new  
versions.  If a new version of ADTWin needs to be released, why  
include all the other components that have not changes?  Thus, I  
think it would be better to have multiple zip files for download.  I  
propose one for each Apple II program, and one for each PC side  
program.  Given the current versions of the components as of today,  
this would result in the following zip files:

Apple II components:

- adt-ssc-1.23.zip: Contains SSC version of adt.dmp (with 115K  
support) and source code.

- adt-cc-1.21.zip: Contains ADTcc.dmp and code.

- adt-gs-0.91.zip: Contains ADTgs.dmp.

PC components:

- adt123.zip: Contains adtdos.exe (with 115K support).

- adt-win-1.23.2.zip: Contains adtwin.exe (with 115K support and long  
file name fixes).

Doing a split like this makes it easier to do updates like the ones  
recently done by Knut and my SST updates.  It also makes it easier to  
put this code into a source code repository, like Subversion.  Which  
leads me to:

Put All ADT Source Code Into Subversion
=======================================

Using a source code control tool like Subversion or CVS is nearly  
essential when multiple developers are involved.  Without them,  
people are constantly overwriting other's changes.

I've been using Subversion a lot at my &quot;real job&quot; and it's awesome.   
This is why I chose BerliOS, too.

Using a Cross Assembler for Apple II Software
=============================================

The code for ADTssc and ADTcc are in Merlin assembler.  I think  
converting these to a cross assembler so that developement code be  
done on a PC/Mac has number of advantages:

- Faster: Running an assembler on modern hardware is *fast*.

- Easier: I can use a modern text editor.

- More flexible: Modern assemblers allow splitting programs into  
multiple files and have the concept of &quot;libraries&quot;.  Multiple files  
also help when multiple developers are involved.

- Makes some debugging easier: I can assembly on my PC/Mac and then  
run the binary in an emulator.

I've already converted adt.asm into an assembly file that is usable  
by ca65, which is the assembler component of cc65:

   <A HREF="http://www.cc65.org/">http://www.cc65.org/</A>

Redesign of PC-Side Software
============================

There are currently two &quot;official&quot; PC-side programs: adtdos.exe and  
adt.exe.  Unfortunately, there is very little code sharing between  
them.  And this also excludes other platforms like Linux and Mac OS  
X.  The current code is currently not flexible enough to support this  
kind of abstraction.  It really needs to be completely restructured  
from scratch.

For my ADT/SST merger, I've already done a fair amount of this  
restructuring.  One major change I did was to use C++ instead of C.   
All platforms we're targeting, including DOS, have good C++ compilers  
available.  C++ provides a lot more flexibility on code structure in  
my opinion, so I sort of made an executive decision to use it over  
C.  Also, using C++ will help us implement my next idea:  I'd also  
like ADTWin to use wxWidgets for it's GUI:

   <A HREF="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">http://www.wxwidgets.org/</A>

wxWidgets is a cross-platform, open source GUI library, available for  
Windows, Unix, and OS X.  Using wxWidgets for ADTWin would  
automatically give use GUIs for Linux and OS X.  I've used wxWidgets  
before, and the ADT GUI is a perfect use for it.

Conclusion
==========

Okay, I know this is a lot of information.  If you manage to read all  
this, please let me know what you think.

-Dave
